	Over the past several decades, there has been an immense effort to model the solar atmosphere and the underlying convective zone through numerical approximations of magnetohydrodynamics. These models 
	
	Magnetohydrodynamics is a popular 
	
	The solar atmosphere is a chaotic environment characterized by million-degree plasma driven by intense magnetic fields originating deep within the solar convective zone. 
	A coupled system of nonlinear differential equations composed of conservation of mass, momentum and energy, along with Maxwell's equations are used to model the statistical behavior of the plasma in the solar atmosphere. This system of equations is known as magnetohydro
	
	
	The statistical behavior of this plasma is governed by magnetohydrodynamics (MHD) which consists of a nonlinear coupled system of differential equations describing conservation of mass, momentum, and energy
	
	
	use conservation of mass, momentum and energy, along with Maxwell's equations to predict future configurations of the plasma given some initial condition. 
	Unfortunately, the MHD equations have no known analytic solutions over an arbitrary domain, so solutions must be approximated using numerical techniques.
	
	Possibly the most popular technique for numerical solutions of the MHD equations is known as explicit finite-difference, where
